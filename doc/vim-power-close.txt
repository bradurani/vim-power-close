*vim-power-close.txt* A vim plugin allowing you to close any type of window with a single function

provides a single function called `powerclose#close`

It is able to close the following:
- a buffer, saving first (with '`:w` `:bd`)
- a new empty buffer (with `:bd!`)
- a readonly buffer (with `:bd!`)
- a [neovim](https://neovim.io/) terminal (with `:bd!`)

vim-power-close do **not** map any keys by default. To use it you will need to
create a mapping such as:
